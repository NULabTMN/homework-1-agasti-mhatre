        <text>THE British battleship Dreadnought,
4 launched from Portsmouth dock
yard by the King on February 10.
marks a notable advance in naval
design. It is not, of course, revo
lutionary, as was the French La Glolre
of 1857 or the American Monitor of 18C2.
The type is as clearly evolved from the
Lord Nelson class as that' class is derived
from the King Edward VII group. But,
new departure/or not, no ship of war
has since the advent of the La plolre—
now historically famous as the first sea
going ironclad— and of 'the Monitor
aroused so much technical interest and
excited so much public curiosity.
It is at this stage impossible to describe
•with exactness all the elements of the
DTeadnough't's design, for its secrets have
been kept with such, admirable close
ness that t the facts are known only to
a limited circle. Even so eminent a critic
as Sir William White, late chief con
structor ;of the^Brltlsh navy, seems to
have based an! adverse 'opinion of the type
on wrong assumptions and \it\u25a0: is safe \u25a0to
cay with the London' Engineer, If a: per-
Bon of hl« enormous experience could be
led into error, how less likely Is it that
the opinions and deductions of lefser
lights will prove correct It xnay there
fore be well to add that the general de
scription of the Dreadnought "has been
taken from conservative i and apparently
reliable accounts that have appeared In
such trustworthy; Journals^ as the En
gineer and Engineering of .London and
the i: Naval and Military Record of
Plymouth.
.During, the five months that the Dread
nought has been "under construction suf
ficient truth has,' however,^ been whispered
to prove that the new ship Is an incorpo-
?HE V- SAN FRANCISCO/^SUNDAY^ CALL;
ratlonof ideas, some suggested and some,
older and evolutionary, confirmed by the
results of the Russo-Japanese sea war.
It is fairly, well t known, for example,'
that the vessel is to possess an enormous
concentration sof offensive and "defensive
energies through the installation "*l. of a
main battery of v 12-Inch guns, that the
usual intermediate battery.- 1 has been
eliminated, -that: the Babcock-Wilcox
.water tube boilers are to develop J 23,000
horsepower,^ and that the turbine engines
are expected to give an average sea' speed
of twenty/or twenty-one knotsJ The ax
mor protection is to Ibe distributed tover
a large area and ito thick v enough \u25a0; to
resist the direct impact of 12-lnch projec-'
tiles fired over a range of 3000 yards.^The
ship's underwater, body is to be arranged
so i as" to^ furnish Vaj reasonable -immunity,
from automatic torpedoes i and fixed j or'
floating, mines. 'One further adyantagei is
the gain in; fighting 'simplificatlonr- due" to
the single class v and the uniform service
of the; ammunition '.needed.;:,'
So far ;'as the jusiial technical data it "is stated*, by; London Engineering
the Dreadnought is 500 feet long," 82 feet in
beam and'-at a displacement of 18,000 tons
will; draw 26 if eet l of water. The] boilers
are 'of the Babcock ;"Wilcox type, ;,with
a pressure of 250 pounds: there. are four
propell ex shafts, and with a horsepower of
23,000 the speed, wilU be about .twenty-one*
knots. Apart. from the novel feature, found
in the abolition of the? secondary arma
ment, there fare several other notable de-^
partures from accepted design. Two stern
posts and two rudders, placed some' twen
ty feet apart.V are provided. .The ten
twelve-inch guns *of the main armament
are? arranged ''in -three barbettes, each
mounting a pair of guns on the 1 keel line,
one on the poop/ one abaft the funnels
and one on the high forecastle., The other
two pairs will be in, hooded barbettes, lo
cated on either; bow, so that the I fire
ahead will be from'- six guns, the fire
astern from two and on the broadside
from no less than. eight. -This, is a very
great gain indeed, for there can be small
doubt that broadside Is far more; im
portant «than end-on fire. The -Dread
nought will, when heed arises, -be a good
ship Z in a chase; her stern fire is, of
course,'. weak, but then she. is not likely to
be found showing her stern" to anything
that floats. The torpedo defense gun rls
now, spoken of as an cighteen-pounder,
but? they number -to be mounted; is not
Btated." -T '\u25a0..- ',h ''\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0*'\u25a0 .-.'.'\u25a0\u25a0.'\u25a0.>
It is, however, claimed; In: other, quar
ters that the f oregolng_dJsposition of the
main armament is not accurate, \u25a0 and .that
the twelve-inch 'guns (45-callber in' length)
are 'to'; be mounted level on the upper, i? deck. ITwb- of these
are to be carried in a' forward and two in
lan after' barbette,' situated on the fore
"and aft line of the ship. Three, are to Vbe
mounted each in a i single barbette on
either broadside. This disposition :of .the
big \u25a0 guns is, therefore, a close reproduc-1
tiori of that installed in the Lord Ntlson,
the "onlyj substantial^ changes being the
substitution \u25a0\u25a0 of 12-inch ordnance for, the
9.2-inch i intermediates (of the i earlier' de
sign. .Whichever plan is 'adopted, ;^the
j cumulative effect' of eight guns fired to
gether" in -broadside; must f; be enormous,
and the effect even of a single shot, owing
to 't the great increase in- energy of .these
latest gun '.types, must be most destructive
even at the new, fighting ranges. It should
be kept in mind that future actions will
probably be fought at ranges J so extended
that -\u25a0 only J the heaviest shots j will in any
final sense count. VThe flat the
line' of projected* flight-^can> also; be so
low that no zone of /safety^ will exist with
in effective torpedo. range.'x-rj
v What, It I may asked; r will the Ad-
miralty with '-j aY ship f of this tre
mendous i power wheni she Is'commis
sioned? With .the ten 12-inch guns of
the 'latest 'type opposed Uo -the, four
mounted in; even the bast foreign bat
tleships, she should be equal to any two
vessels now, afloat. In defensive quali
ties she will, thanks to the thickness
and; quality of her armor, ba Immune
from damage by gunfire at ordinary
battle ranges. It is generally believed
that* the Dreadnought will be assigned
v to* I the Atlantic fleet, which is the
"pivot" force of the British navy. In
the late "battle practice" the King Ed
ward VII, flagship of this fleet, when
steaming. at* fifteen knots, fired, eleven
shells from her four 12-inch guns and
hit ten /times a target distant nearly
three and a half; miles. Thirty-one
rounds were discharged with her four
9. 2 -inch guns, making fifteen hits, and
out of seventy-one rounds twenty-six
hits were scored by the 6-lnchjguns. If
the Dreadnought, with ten 12-inch guns,
equals the record the target will, under
similar conditions, be pierced twenty
times. -In addition to the Dreadnought
the Atlantic fleet will include, irrespec
tive of armored cruisers and other com
ponents and auxiliaries; seven battle
ships of the King. Edward VII type,
each mounting -four 12-inch, four 9.2
inch and, ten 6-lnch guns. Assuming
that .circumstances enabled each of
these." eight men-of-war to put in a full
broadside every minute, the following'
weight of shells would be discharged:
Pounds.
Dreadnought 6,800
Seven King Edward VITs... 51,940
Total 53,740
The calculation is based on the mod
estTassumptio^n that from. each 12-inch
gun one shell will be fired a minute,
fromeach" 9.2-inch two and from every
6-inch five,-' This* rate is frequently ex
ceeded, but it may suffice as an "average
\u25a0 fora fleetof .eight ships. -On this basis
the total 'discharge each minute from
the Atlantic fleet firing broadside-on
at "an. enemy is more^than twfcnty-'six
tons of metal. Presuming the stand
ard of the King Edward -Vll's 12-Inch
guns -is twenty-three ton 3,
would get therefore home, in the ships'
ofjahy foeUhat chanced to be the ob
jective.V"'No thing so_£ overwhelming as
this .concentrated destruction has"ever
been conceived in the brain of man. It
is impossible .to picture ;the result of.
one minute's lwell .s directed ,flre at an
\u25a0 enemy's ships, and'vwhen the 'gunners
get the range and fire as at target prac-
tlce, one minute being followed hy.
others, the effect will be annihilation.
To this length has the contest for se*
power gone, and even this la not the
end.
These possibilities result from the as
tonishing advances in heavier ordnanco.
Until within a few years the British 12
inch gun was 40 calAers in length and de
veloped a velocity of about 2500 feet
per \u25a0second. It is interesting to learn
that each of the 45-callber 12-inch euns
of the Dreadnaught is to be something
like 30 per cent more powerful than tha
12-lnch employed two years ago. It will
have double th© power of the 9.2-inch,,
nearly five times the power of tha 7.5
and eight times that of the 6-lsch. Be
tween ISD2 and 1902 the collective muzzle
energy from one round of battleship guns
Increased 22 per cent, whereas between
1902 and 1906 the advance has been 147
per cent.
Moreover, the maintenance of enerrn
and penetrative power at long range is
favored by a greater weight of projectile,
and heavy cuns have as a corollary the
advantage over light pieces. At long
ranges the improved optical devices for
sighting and range finding demanded
have been speedily provided by inventive)
Ingenuity, and this combination of tha
various devices with a natural aptitude
for. getting on the target and with a ra
tional and progressive training is pro
ducing results that are nearly marvelous.
The maximum fighting range of tha
Dreadnaughfs 12-lnch guns,' for ex
ample, is five miles, and the chances ot
hitting targets at this distance aro
auite good. "Since we have been devel
oping larger battleships," declares Cap
tain Wain wright. U. S. N., in the Pro
ceedings of the Naval Institute, "the
power of hitting with -big guns has been
Increasing. by leaps and bounds. All ord
nance material has improved, and the
training of officers and 'men; has become
scientific. Now the heaviest guns can b©
fired as rapidly as the intermediate guns
could be fired formerly, and with them,
they can make 1 more' hits than the light
er guns could make in earlier times. The
old theories of a 'smothering fire*, and 'a
greater number of units* must be allowed
to die, _as one or two hits from the big
guns can destroy soft ends and wreck
weak battery spaces, and such guns alone
are able to attack the life of the ship.</text>

        <text>GERMANY'S BATTLESHIPS.
One of the leading naval powers which re
organized their j»olicj- promptly when the
Dreadnought was launched last February is
Germany. She has bpeu building two battle
ships a year for several years, and decided that
the next ones authorized should be a match for
the vessel now under construction at Torts
mouth. The Tribunes London correspondent
declares that the Kaiser is not entirely satis
fied with the decision reached a few months
ago. and that the Ersatz Bayern aud Ersatz
Sachaea will !>e bigger than the Dreadnought.
From other sources it is learned that these
ships will probably have a displacement of
1!».000 tons, instead of 18,0<>0 (as originally
planned), and will mount sixteen 1 1-inch guns.
The Dreadnoughts main battery is to consist
of ten 12-incfa guns.
by this news. She bus been setting tbe pace
for the rest of the world for years, and Is under
no obligation to limit herself in the future to
vessels like the Dreadnought. Nevertheless, it
would be bard to predict the outcome of an en
gagement between that particular ship and one
of tbe kind which the Kaiser now has in his
mind's The Dreadnought is expected to
be t lit* faster ship. She has Iteen designed to
develop a sptvd of "Jl knots, whereas the new
German battleships are intended to develop
tiuly IM^.. Tbe ship which can manoeuvre best
In action bas a great advantage over its ad
versary. Again, trifling as is the difference in
tbe calibre of their guns, it might have an
appreciable effect under certain conditions. Just
now everything is being sacrificed to long range,
and tbe range of a camion Is approximately
proportioned t« its bore, if it should prove that
the Dreaduought't) guns could begin the work
of destruction a few minutes earlier than those
of her enemy, thai qualification might more
than offset the ability to throw more hundred
weight of metal n minute.
It is not at all unlikely that Germany's dis
satiafaction with the plans adopted early in the
V-ar has been Inspired less by what is being
ilone by Great Britain than by hints of what
other powers luive in view. Admiral Dewey
told the House Committee <-v Naval Affairs four
or rive- months ago that lie had reason to sus
peel that Japan bad decided on 19,000-ton
battleships. Besides, while Secretary Kona
parte's plans were not perfected at that time,
it is no secret that the United States Navy De
partment wanted the privilege «.f building a
warship of greater size than any of which there
was luen any assurance. Fortunately or un
fortunately, the Secretary could not secure the
authority to proceed Quietly with the realiza
tion of thai purpose, but it is not to be supposed
that the government in Berlin was kept in
ignorance regarding bis Intentions,
Germany is now taking un exceptionally long
stride in the development of her navy. She
doubtless realizes that iv HJine respects she has
been backward, and is eager to make up for
lost time. The I'nited States has ready for ser
vice, if not actually In commission, five battle
ships displacing 15,000 tons each, and having a
spaed of 19 knots. Two vessels of the Louisiana
Ihss. displacing 16,000 tons and developing a
K|>eed of is knots, are virtually completed, and
four more are under construction. The biggest
Ships now being built for Germany have a dis
placement of 13/JUO tons. The keels of two
were laid last year, two others were launched
in iftOfi. and one of that particular class (the
Deutachland) is now finished of another
group, having a displacement of {.'mm> tons
exactly, four are ready for -service, If not in
commission, and a fifth is rapidly approaching
completion. The older German battleships are
comparable in size with thorn* of the classes to
which the Oregon, the Illinois and the Mahip be
long. Borne of them mount nothing larger than
0.4-iiicli guns, however, while the biggest guns
on American battleships Invariably nave a
calibre of 12 or IS inches. Apparently there has
been room for Improvement in the weight of
Germany's naval ordnance n« well as In tbe

        <text>JAPANS BIG SHIP AFLOAT.
The Satsuvia. Rivalling Great Brit
ain's Dreadnought, Launched.
Toklo. Nov. 15.— The first class Japanese bat
tleship Satsuma, of 19,000 tons, the first battle
ship to be launched in Japanese waters, took the
water to-day In the presence of the Emperor.
The greatest enthusiasm was manifested. The
newspapers here reflect the epoch making natur.i
of tlii event, as indicated by tho unprecedented
presence of the Emperor, and eulogize the suc
cess of the naval constructors. It is taken for
granted that the ship Is the equal, nnd perhaps
the superior, of any other warship afloat.
The Satsuma 1« the first battleship of modern
construction to be launched in Japan, and is be
lieved to be equal to the Pritish battleship
Dreadnouphi. According to th« Tokio corre
spondent of "The London Daily Telegraph," the
Satsuma embodies all the lessons of the war be
tween Japan and Russia. The woodwork on
board has been reduced to a minimum, tho ves
sel is fitted with elaborate fire apparatus, and
her upper works have been kept as clear of top
hamper as possible. The details of her con
struction follow in the main those of the Dread
nought, whose steaming capacity the Satsuma
is expected to excel.</text>

Comparisons of expenditures for
military and naval purpoesby the'
five leading Powers (Russia being
excluded) made by the informa
tion bureaus of the War and Navy
Departments at Washington are
apt to shock this peace-loving Na
tion, which has been accustomed
to hold up its hands in horror of
the burden of militarism under
which Europe is staggering.
It has been impressed upon the
public mind in recent years that
our expenditures for military and
naval purposes were growing rapid-
ly, but it was not suspected that
we had, entered so'extensively into
the race for military and naval su
premacy with the European Pow- j
ers. tor the present year threat
Britain's expenditures for the army
will amount to $156,000,000.
Curiously enough France and
Germany will spend about the
same amount $158,000,000-</text>

warship of the Deutschland class which
was steaming at the head of a German

The Deutschland is a battleship of
12,997 tons displacement with a length
of 430 feet and a beam of 72 feet. Her
complement in time of peace is 729
men. The other battleships of the same
class are the Schlesien, Schleswig-Hol
